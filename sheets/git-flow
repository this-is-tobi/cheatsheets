# Git Flow

## Branches

Used branches are :
- `feature branches` (format `fix/wrong-header-title`)
- `hotfix branches` (format `hotfix/wrong-header-title`)
- `develop`
- `main`

Feature branches should be merged into the `develop` branch, and the `develop` branch should be merged into the `main` branch (i.e. `feature > develop > main`).

Hotfix branches should be merged directly into the `main` branch (i.e `hotfix > main`), and the `develop` branch should then be rebased on the `main` branch.


## Conventional commits

Commits should follow the specification of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), it is possible to add the [VSCode extension](https://github.com/vivaxy/vscode-conventional-commits) to facilitate creating commits.

A PR must be made with a branch up-to-date with the `develop` branch (use rebase to keep your branch up-to-date, not merge) before requesting a fusion, and the fusion must be requested into `develop`.

### Cheatsheet

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```txt
<type>[(<scope>)][!]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types definition:

| Type       | Description                                                    |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build`    | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies. |
| `chore`    | Other changes that don't modify src or test files.             |
| `ci`       | Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.                 |
| `docs`     | Documentation only changes.                                    |

| `perf`     | A code change that improves performance.                       |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither foxes a bug nor adds a feature.     |
| `revert`   | Reverts a previous commit.                                     |

## Git Cheatsheet

#### Create a feature branch

```sh
# Put the head on the `develop` branch
git checkout develop

# Pull `develop` branch updates
git pull

# Create and checkout on the branch `feat/my-feature-description`
git checkout -b feat/my-feature-description

# Add files to the staging area
git add -A

# Create a commit
git commit -m 'feat: my feature description'

# Push the branch to remote
git push --set-upstream origin feat/my-feature-description

# Create a pull request
gh pr create --fill --base main --head develop
```

#### Rebase a branch on another

```sh
# Put the head on the `develop` branch
git checkout develop

# Pull `develop` branch updates
git pull

# Put the head on the `feat/my-feature-description` branch
git checkout feat/my-feature-description

# Rebase the `feat/my-feature-description` branch on the recently pulled `develop` branch
git rebase develop

## Optionaly resolve conflicts

# Push `feat/my-feature-description` updates to remote
git push --force-with-lease --force-if-includes
```

#### Add files to the staging area with interactive mode

```sh
# Add all files interactively
git add -A -p

---

# Add given file interactively
git add -p path/to/file
```
